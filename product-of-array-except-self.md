# Product of Array Except Self

## Problem

Given an integer array nums, return an array answer such that answer[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].

The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and without using the division operation.

Example 1

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]  
Output: [24,12,8,6]

Example 2

Input: nums = [-1,1,0,-3,3]  
Output: [0,0,9,0,0]

Constraints

2 <= nums.length <= 10^5  
-30 <= nums[i] <= 30

## Solution

```python
class Solution(object):
    def productExceptSelf(self, nums):
        n = len(nums)
        answer = [1] * n

        prefix = 1
        for i in range(n):
            answer[i] = prefix
            prefix *= nums[i]

        suffix = 1
        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            answer[i] *= suffix
            suffix *= nums[i]

        return answer
